9.<b>Time Classes:</b> Used to handle time calculations, scheduling, and managing alarms.<br/>
10.<b>RecyclerView:</b> If you plan to display a list of alarms, the RecyclerView widget can be used for efficient management of the alarm list.<br/>
11.<b>Material Design Components:</b> Google's design system for creating visually appealing and consistent user interfaces.<br/>
12.<b>Vibration:</b> Android provides APIs to control device vibration, which can be used as an additional way to alert the user when the alarm goes off.<br/>
13.<b>SQLite Database:</b> If you want to add more advanced features like saving multiple alarms or history, a database can be used to store and manage this data.<br/>
14.<b>Permissions Handling:</b> Depending on the functionality, you might need to request permissions like "Wake Lock" to keep the device awake when the alarm triggers.<br/>
